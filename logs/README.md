# Logs Summary

This folder collects tool-generated reports for the internship’s CPU prototype. The project’s goal is to build a minimal processor while practicing digital design techniques, and these logs document synthesis, timing, power, and rule-check results so we can track progress and guide next steps throughout the internship.

All reports were generated by Vivado v2025.1 for the `cpu` design targeting device `xc7z010clg400-1`.

## Clock Reports
- **Clock Interaction:** No clocks found. Without defined clocks, synchronous elements cannot be analyzed, leaving timing and functionality uncertain.
- **Clock Networks:** Top-level clock `clk` is unconstrained with 2,080 endpoints. Unconstrained clocks may lead to timing violations and unpredictable behavior in silicon.

## Design Rule Check (DRC)
- Single `ZPS7-1` warning indicating the PS7 block is required but absent. If the processing system is truly needed, omitting it could prevent the design from booting or integrating with external logic.

## Methodology
- `TIMING-17` critical warnings: 1,000 non-clocked sequential cells. Lacking clocks, these registers may never toggle, masking functional bugs and invalidating timing analysis.
- `SYNTH-5` warnings: 256 instances mapped to distributed LUT RAM because of timing constraints. Overuse of distributed RAM can waste LUT resources and still fail to meet the desired performance.

## Power
- Total on-chip power **3.618 W** (dynamic 3.453 W, static 0.165 W) with overall confidence **Low**. Underestimating power may lead to overheating or power-supply issues in deployment.
- Program counter module `u_pc` contributes the largest share at **1.588 W**. Concentrated power in this block could create thermal hotspots or require additional cooling.

## Timing Summary
- 2,080 register/latch pins lack an associated clock source. Unclocked pins cannot be analyzed, making it impossible to guarantee correct operation over time.
- 11,328 internal endpoints are unconstrained for maximum delay. Without constraints, paths may violate setup/hold requirements and introduce metastability.
- 1 input port and 35 output ports have no delay specifications. Unspecified delays hinder interface timing and can cause communication failures.
- No user-defined timing constraints were supplied. Absent constraints leave the tools guessing, often resulting in hardware that fails to meet performance targets.

## Utilization
- 2,439 slice LUTs used (13.86%), including 1,415 as logic (8.04%) and 1,024 as distributed RAM (17.07%).
- 1,056 slice registers used (3.00%).
- No block RAM, DSP, IO, or clocking resources are utilized.
- Vivado warns that the final LUT count may decrease after physical optimization.

## Next Steps
- Define explicit clock constraints so `clk` and other sequential elements are properly timed.
- Resolve the `ZPS7-1` warning by integrating the PS7 block or adjusting the design to remove the dependency.
- Add input/output delay constraints and cover unconstrained endpoints to prevent further timing issues.
- Run Vivado physical optimization passes to validate warnings and potentially reduce LUT usage.
