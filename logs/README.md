# Logs Summary

All reports were generated by Vivado v2025.1 for the `cpu` design targeting device `xc7z010clg400-1`.

## Clock Reports
- **Clock Interaction:** No clocks found.
- **Clock Networks:** Top-level clock `clk` is unconstrained with 2,080 endpoints.

## Design Rule Check (DRC)
- Single `ZPS7-1` warning indicating the PS7 block is required but absent.

## Methodology
- `TIMING-17` critical warnings: 1,000 non-clocked sequential cells.
- `SYNTH-5` warnings: 256 instances mapped to distributed LUT RAM because of timing constraints.

## Power
- Total on-chip power **3.618 W** (dynamic 3.453 W, static 0.165 W) with overall confidence **Low**.
- Program counter module `u_pc` contributes the largest share at **1.588 W**.

## Timing Summary
- 2,080 register/latch pins lack an associated clock source.
- 11,328 internal endpoints are unconstrained for maximum delay.
- 1 input port and 35 output ports have no delay specifications.
- No user-defined timing constraints were supplied.

## Utilization
- 2,439 slice LUTs used (13.86%), including 1,415 as logic (8.04%) and 1,024 as distributed RAM (17.07%).
- 1,056 slice registers used (3.00%).
- No block RAM, DSP, IO, or clocking resources are utilized.
- Vivado warns that the final LUT count may decrease after physical optimization.
